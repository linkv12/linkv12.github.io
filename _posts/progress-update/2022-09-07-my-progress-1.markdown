I need to do a lot. Still so much, like this blog need update, the about page is still default jekyll template. 
What I accomplish today ? 
- I read a paper 
- I edit my paper(just a bit)

The paper i read is [How important are activation functions in regression and classification? A survey, performance comparison, and future directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02681). I only understand that using linear activation will result to a slower learning, and non linear will result to a better learning, but there are still a lot to improve in this part.

I need to write and read more paper. Don't forget to download example paper since I can't write to save my skin. But I believe a step taken is still a progress.
